/**
 * A Manager of Swing Actions
 * <p>
 * A singleton class used for managing application Actions.  Components
 * can create and register actions with the ActionManager.  Other components
 * can grab the actions and customize them by setting callbacks for action event
 * handling, enabled state control, group control, toggle control and more.
 * <p>
 * The ActionXMLReader can read an XML file that describe Actions and register
 * them with the ActionManager.
 * <p>
 * The ActionUIFactory uses the ActionManager's lists to create menus and
 * toolbars.
 * <p>
 * <em>Please see the package documentation to understand the important difference
 * between global and local actions.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Global vs. Local Actions and Action Lists (or getXXX() vs. createXXX()) </h3>
 * <p>
 * In general usage, there is one global Action instance for each registered id.  The
 * action instance is returned for each getAction() call and is shared amongst
 * every list that referes to the action in every getActionList() result.  Similarly,
 * a call to getActionList() returns the same global instance, whose Actions it refers
 * to are also global.
 * <p>
 * In same cases, this motif is insufficient.  Think about a good editor that allows
 * one to view two different files side by side.  Each side has a popup menu, but the
 * menu choices in the left popup apply to the document on the left and the menu choices
 * on the right effect the document on the right.  Depending on the type or contents of
 * the document the menus may change in enablement, selection, contents, etc.  Sharing one
 * action list would be inappropriate - adding In this case, the developer may want to
 * create two different ActionLists that have different instances of types of Action,
 * each pointing to their respective documents (perhaps as the Actions' context).  These
 * are <em>local</em> Actions and <em>local</em> Action Lists.
 * <p>
 * Action prototypes, represented by instances of the class ActionAttributes,
 * can be registered with the ActionManager.  The prototypes are used to create
 * actions.  Prototypes are always registered when using an XML file.
 * Prototypes can be registered when not using an XML file as well.  Prototypes
 * are sufficient in most cases, and necessary when a global action is
 * insuffiecient, i.e. - when a single action id can have more than one
 * instance created for it.  An example of this usage is a toolbar that belongs
 * to a specific component where the component can appear multiple times on the
 * screen at once.  Each toolbar must run in the context of its component and
 * would typically have the component's state, thus necessitating two instances.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Actions Lists, Action Id Lists, and Instance</h3>
 * <p>
 * Similarly, Action ID lists serve as prototypes for Action lists.  An Action
 * Id list contains action ids.  A global action list exists for each created
 * action id list, and is available from getActionList(Object listId).  Action
 * id lists only contain ids.  Action lists contain actual actions.  Components
 * such as toolbars and menu bars can be created by passing an action list to
 * the ActionUIFactory.
 * <p>
 * More than one instance of an action list can be created by calling
 * createActionList(id).  This may be handy if there are two menus who start
 * out the same but have their contents change, though this is behavior is
 * not managed by the ActionManager or respected by the ActionUIFactory.
 * <p>
 * Both action id lists and action lists can be multileveled.  They may contain
 * lists as members.  In the case of action id lists, these sub-lists contain
 * other action ids (or more sub lists).  Action lists contain lists of actions
 * or sublists of action (or more sub lists).
 * <p>
 * Any of the above Lists can be ActionList's.  An ActionList is a special List
 * that can describe the action (by id) of action that is associated with
 * entire list.  This allows, for example, an Action to be associated with a
 * top-level menu.  The Action is fired when menu becomes visible.
 * <p>
 * Please see package documentation for thorough usage descriptions.
 * <p>
 * Valid for JDK 1.3 and later.
 * <p>
 * @author Michael Bushe - owner.  Wrote, refactored, converged or re-wrote
 * most of it. Blame all issues on him.
 * @author Mark Davidson - Sun Swing team member - donated an ActionManager
 * included into this one (by reworking it) ex post facto.
 * @version 1.0
