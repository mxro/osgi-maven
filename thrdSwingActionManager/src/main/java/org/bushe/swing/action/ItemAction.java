/**
 * Interface for Actions that can deal with ItemEvents, such as
 * toggle and group buttons.
 * <p>
 * Typically this interface is not used.  One would typically add an
 * actionListener to toggle-like actions, since the action will get fired
 * when the buttons toggle selection.  This interface is to implement the
 * ability to set the selection state on the action and have it propogate to
 * widgets that share the action (toolbar button and right-click menu would
 * both look selected).  This ability is provided by the ActionUIFactory, but
 * can be implemented by any widget.
