 * This class takes an action and modifies into a prototype of the

 * Feel Design Guidelines are used.  Since actions are merely name-value
 * pairs (including, but not limited to values of names defined in
 * java.util.Action), then an action look and feel is merely a definition
 * of sets of name-value pairs, one set per named action.
